Are you a control freak that feels like everything is out of control? Do your projects at work seem like chaos no matter how much order you try to bring? Do you feel like your family, friends and kids never listen? Here's how to escape: hit the gym. 

Are you sick of that guilty, disgusting feeling after you've binged on potato chips, Pinterest, fatty food and Facebook? Divest that hour and invest in working out an hour instead. Do you have zero team athletic ability and no hand-eye coordination? Wait... that's me.

Personally, my gym hour before work on weekdays is my time, and I love it that way. I take the frustration from emails, red tape, and computer errors at work and channel that frustration to push out one more rep. I can't control negative responses from book publishers, no responses from potential employers, an empty inbox from dating.com, or favorite projects getting the ax. But this I can control. This is why I hit the weights, stair master, and jump rope.

We emphasize and monetize athleticism to a fault, but it does teaches us three important lessons: persistence, discipline, and playing a long game. The gratification comes slowly, the failure rate remains high, and the game takes forever. But if you can persist, health and good looks are just two rewards. You can feel you've taken control of your health, food, and physique when work, traffic, unhappy spouses, and screaming kids remain out of your control. 

When friends you haven't seen since last summer's river float say "Wow! You've been hitting the gym!" To them, you'll say "thanks!" To yourself, you'll say "Wow, I haven't been wasting my time in the gym after all!" Staying in shape is a sport for all seasons, and although others tend to notice only during the warm ones, we can enjoy the high health benefits and lower doctor bills year-round.

Getting and staying healthy is one of the few things in life we can control. It's a fight we can win. No one can fight a one-man or one-woman war, but we can rebel against the food industrial complex and resist its oppressively addictive mixture of salt, sugar, and grease. It's a rebellion we can win and be proud of fighting. So fight the power, stick it to the man, and hit the gym.
